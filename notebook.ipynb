The NIST Special Publication 800-63B\n<p>If you – 50 years ago – needed to come up with a secret password you were probably part of a secret espionage organization or (more likely) you were pretending to be a spy when playing as a kid. Today, many of us are forced to come up with new passwords <em>all the time</em> when signing into sites and apps. As a password <em>inventeur</em> it is your responsibility to come up with good, hard-to-crack passwords. But it is also in the interest of sites and apps to make sure that you use good passwords. The problem is that it's really hard to define what makes a good password. However, <em>the National Institute of Standards and Technology</em> (NIST) knows what the second best thing is: To make sure you're at least not using a <em>bad</em> password. </p>\n<p>In this notebook, we will go through the rules in <a href=\"https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html\">NIST Special Publication 800-63B</a> which details what checks a <em>verifier</em> (what the NIST calls a second party responsible for storing and verifying passwords) should perform to make sure users don't pick bad passwords. We will go through the passwords of users from a fictional company and use python to flag the users with bad passwords. But us being able to do this already means the fictional company is breaking one of the rules of 800-63B:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Verifiers SHALL store memorized secrets in a form that is resistant to offline attacks. Memorized secrets SHALL be salted and hashed using a suitable one-way key derivation function.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is, never save users' passwords in plaintext, always encrypt the passwords! Keeping this in mind for the next time we're building a password management system, let's load in the data.</p>\n<p><em>Warning: The list of passwords and the fictional user database both contain <strong>real</strong> passwords leaked from <strong>real</strong> websites.

Is <code>11111</code> repetitive? Yes! Is <code>12345</code> repetitive? Well, kind of. Is <code>13579</code> repetitive? Maybe not..? To check for <em>repetitiveness</em> can be arbitrarily complex, but here we're only going to do something simple. We're going to flag all passwords that contain 4 or more repeated characters.</p>","metadata":{"tags":["context"],"deletable":false,"run_control":{"frozen":true},"dc":{"key":"45"},"editable":false},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"execution_count":347,"source":"### Flagging the users with passwords with >= 4 repeats\nusers['too_many_repeats'] = users['password'].str.contains(r'(.)\\1\\1\\1')\n\n# Taking a look at the users with too many repeats\nusers[users['too_many_repeats']]","metadata":{"trusted":true,"tags":["sample_code"],"dc":{"key":"45"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":347,"output_type":"execute_result","metadata":{},"data":{"text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>id</th>\n      <th>user_name</th>\n      <th>password</th>\n      <th>length</th>\n      <th>too_short</th>\n      <th>common_password</th>\n      <th>common_word</th>\n      <th>first_name</th>\n      <th>last_name</th>\n      <th>uses_name</th>\n      <th>too_many_repeats</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>146</th>\n      <td>147</td>\n      <td>patti.dixon</td>\n      <td>555555</td>\n      <td>6</td>\n      <td>True</td>\n      <td>True</td>\n      <td>False</td>\n      <td>patti</td>\n      <td>dixon</td>\n      <td>False</td>\n      <td>True</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>572</th>\n      <td>573</td>\n      <td>cornelia.bradley</td>\n      <td>555555</td>\n      <td>6</td>\n      <td>True</td>\n      <td>True</td>\n      <td>False</td>\n      <td>cornelia</td>\n      <td>bradley</td>\n      <td>False</td>\n      <td>True</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>644</th>\n      <td>645</td>\n      <td>essie.lopez</td>\n      <td>11111</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>True</td>\n      <td>True</td>\n      <td>False</td>\n      <td>essie</td>\n      <td>lopez</td>\n      <td>False</td>\n      <td>True</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>798</th>\n      <td>799</td>\n      <td>charley.key</td>\n      <td>888888</td>\n      <td>6</td>\n      <td>True</td>\n      <td>True</td>\n      <td>False</td>\n      <td>charley</td>\n      <td>key</td>\n      <td>False</td>\n      <td>True</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>807</th>\n      <td>808</td>\n      <td>thurman.osborne</td>\n      <td>rinnnng0</td>\n      <td>8</td>\n      <td>False</td>\n      <td>False</td>\n      <td>False</td>\n      <td>thurman</td>\n      <td>osborne</td>\n      <td>False</td>\n      <td>True</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>941</th>\n      <td>942</td>\n      <td>mitch.ferguson</td>\n      <td>aaaaaa</td>\n      <td>6</td>\n      <td>True</td>\n      <td>True</td>\n      <td>False</td>\n      <td>mitch</td>\n      <td>ferguson</td>\n      <td>False</td>\n      <td>True</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>","text/plain":"      id         user_name  password  length  too_short  common_password  \\\n146  147       patti.dixon    555555       6       True             True   \n572  573  cornelia.bradley    555555       6       True             True   \n644  645       essie.lopez     11111       5       True             True   \n798  799       charley.key    888888       6       True             True   \n807  808   thurman.osborne  rinnnng0       8      False            False   \n941  942    mitch.ferguson    aaaaaa       6       True             True   \n\n     common_word first_name last_name  uses_name  too_many_repeats  \n146        False      patti     dixon      False              True  \n572        False   cornelia   bradley      False              True  \n644        False      essie     lopez      False              True  \n798        False    charley       key      False              True  \n807        False    thurman   osborne      False              True  \n941        False      mitch  ferguson      False              True  "}}],"cell_type":"code"},{"source":"## 8.
